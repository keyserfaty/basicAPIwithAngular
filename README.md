## Basic API with Angular.js front-end ##

This is a version of [Basic API](https://github.com/okbel/basicAPI) with some minor changes in the back-end and a front-end build with Angular.js and [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular).
You can read more about the structure of the back-end [here](https://github.com/okbel/basicAPI).

> This app uses node 5.0 to work. You can change your current version of node with nvm.



**How to get going:**


 1. Run `npm install && bower install` from the root folder.
 2. Run `npm test` to run the app using nodemon or `npm start` for the regular mode.
 3. Go to `localhost:3000` to see the magic!



----------


**TODOS:**
- `ngRoute` shouldn't be used. It will be replaced with `ui-router` in the next version.
